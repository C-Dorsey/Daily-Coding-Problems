This repository is a personal one which contains coding problems from the book 
Daily Coding Problems by Alex Miller and Lawrence Wu along with my solutions to 
the problems. I'm doing these problems in order to both practice and demonstrate 
my coding skills; the purpose to challenge myself and to keep my skills sharp. 
I will solve these problems in both C and Java, along with any other language in
which I wish to practice.
